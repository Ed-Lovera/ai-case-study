## Summary

  This case study examines Microsoft Azure AI Document Intelligence, a product
within Microsoft's Azure AI suite. Launched in 2020, Azure AI Document
Intelligence automates document processing and information extraction using
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies.
The study explores the product's origins, business activities, technological
landscape, market impact, and potential improvements. It highlights Azure AI
Document Intelligence's role in Microsoft's cloud services strategy and its
competitive position in the rapidly evolving field of AI-powered document
processing. The analysis draws on various sources to provide insights into the
product's development, capabilities, and market performance within the broader
context of Microsoft's AI offerings and the competitive landscape of cloud-based
AI services.

## Overview and Origin

  Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen on April 4, 1975 
(Wikipedia, n.d.). Microsoft's product Azure AI Document Intelligence was first
referenced on October 2, 2019 under the product's previous name, Azure Form
Recognizer (Microsoft, October 2, 2019). The product was made publicly available
on July 8, 2020 (Microsoft, July 8, 2020). As a part of Microsoft's Azure AI
suite of products. The purpose of Azure AI Document Intelligence is to provide
businesses with a tool to automate document processing and extraction of
information from documents (Microsoft, 2024), a form of OCR. 

  Although little information is available on the specific origins of Azure AI
Document Intelligence, it is likely that the product was developed in response
to the growing need for document processing and automation in the business
world. In July 14, 2014 Microsoft announced the release of Azure Machine
Learning a fully managed service for advanced analytics in the cloud
(Microsoft, July 14, 2014).

## Business Activities

  Azure AI Services and by extension Azure Document Intelligence are part of
Microsoft's overall business plan to provide comprehensive cloud services to
businesses (David Curry, December 29, 2022).

  When it comes to custom OCR models, Azure AI Document Intelligence offers
exceptional accuracy with a fast time to implement. Azure Document intelligences
combines their pre-built models with their "run-layout" tool that automatically
labels custom documents for fast document preparation and training
(fredwu, September 16, 2023).

  Azure AI Document Intelligence uses ML paired with OCR to extract data such as
text and tables from documents. Although the specific of how these are
implemented and the hardware used are not publicly available.

## Landscape

  The field of OCR has been growing rapidly over the past few decades. Recently,
major players in this field such as Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have been
combining Generative AI such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and provide users
with a chatbot interface to interact with their documents
(Neta Haiby, July 18, 2023; Sundar Pichai & Demis Hassabis, December 6, 2023).

## Results

  Although the specific financial impact of Azure AI Document Intelligence is
not publicly available, it is likely that the product has had a positive impact
on Microsoft's overall revenue and market share. Microsoft's revenue has been on
a steady since the release of Azure AI in 2014 and that trend has kept pace
since the release of Azure AI Document Intelligence in 2020 (Macrotrends, 2024).

In relation to other companies in the field, Microsoft has been able to maintain
a steady place in third position in terms of revenue behind Google and Amazon.
Other competitors such as Adobe, IBM have not been able to keep pace with the
growth of Microsoft and the other two companies (Macrotrends, 2024).

## Recommendations

  A recommendation to improve the product would be to offer a captcha like
service that can be easily implemented into existing websites. So that as a user
of Azure AI Document Intelligence, I could verify that documents are processed
correctly and provide a way to improve the model.
